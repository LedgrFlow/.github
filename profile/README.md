## 🧠 Why was LedgrFlow created?

I am a programmer and finance student. Since learning double-entry bookkeeping at university, I wanted to apply it to my personal life. I like having control and clarity over my finances, but I didn’t feel comfortable doing it in Excel.

Spreadsheets ended up messy, hard to keep structured, and when uploading them to the cloud (like Google Sheets), some accounting formats would break. It was frustrating, especially when I wanted to keep a serious, historical, and professional record.

At university, studying business accounting, I learned something fundamental:

> The importance of keeping a clear, readable accounting history over time to make smart decisions.

This approach led me to look for a way to record my personal finances with the same logic a company would use — but without relying on closed software. That’s when I discovered Ledger: a powerful and flexible plain-text accounting system. I instantly fell in love with its philosophy.

But using Ledger wasn’t practical for daily use: no quick feedback, no modern editor, no clear interface.

LedgrFlow was born — a tool that lets me keep my accounting data in plain text, with Ledger’s accuracy and the usability of a modern app.
